# Cascade - NGO Recognition Project

Cascade is a web application designed to recognize NGOs in a specific area, such as Bhopal, and provide comprehensive information about them in one place. Developed by Rishav Bhardwaz, this project aims to streamline the process of discovering and accessing information about NGOs for users.

## Features

- **NGO Recognition**: Cascade identifies and lists NGOs operating in the designated area.
- **Comprehensive Information**: Users can access detailed information about each NGO, including their mission, activities, contact details, and more.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can easily search for specific NGOs based on keywords or categories.
- **Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**: Cascade is built using modern web development technologies, including Next.js for server-side rendering, TypeScript for static typing, and Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
